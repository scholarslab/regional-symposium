# About

Many of you were at the meeting last fall in the Scholars' Lab with representatives from the Scholars' Lab, Washington and Lee, University of Richmond, and University of Maryland. There we started brainstorming plans for our groups to work together more regularly on a variety of issues, everything from potential grant plans for graduate training to shared speaker series and beyond. March 9th we're planning on continuing those conversations.

The plan is to have people from the institutions listed above working on similar work present and dialogue with each other, and we're working on sessions on student work and pedagogy, social justice, and more. Our goal is to get people talking with and meeting like-minded folks from regional institutions to seed ideas for future collaborations. And in the future, hopefully, we can build outwards from this small group of institutions to involve other like-minded collaborators in the region.
