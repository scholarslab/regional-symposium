* Notes start 9:18 AM
** Administrative things
   JPA wants talk about tracking
*** JPA discusses project
    PL mentions that people being around change how time happen;
    clouds and traffic; cities change the speed; thinking about people
    as heart-cells; it's like clocks; micro-expressions too;
*** pausing to let people speak
    an article, native American community in Canada: Euro-Canadians
    (in scare quotes?); job interviews; didn't respond as quickly as
    the Canadian administrators, so would never get the job; rude
    northerners; article on New York Jewish conversation?
*** TODO Lydia and Bremen: post two article, New York Jewish conversation, native Canadians
*** on the interview
    presumptions about that kind of space; meta-communicative frame;
    not just about eliciting information, it's also about the setup;
    setting up an interview is not a neutral way of getting
    information; meaningfully generative ass;
*** /Lipstick Traces/
    if you want, read it to finish by Thanksgiving; a secret history:
    alternate timeline; not the normal politics? all through the Sex
    Pistols; popular and novelty- kid in the mall with the Mohawk
    haircut; Sex Pistols still throws shade- Guy Debord; deep
    chronology; Frankfurt School as mass culture
*** Phillip K. Dick /Man in the High Castle/
*** diaries written by student soldiers
    1/3 were students from the most elite universities; exceptionally
    well-read: understood the Japanese and Western canon; kept really
    extensive diaries about time and meaning and purpose; how time
    stretches out and constricts; lamenting immanent death; people who
    could understand how the west and east works; ideas of honor,
    enmeshed; if you're captured, you kill yourself; interesting
    personal and meta-view; completely aware that the states is
    deploying all this symbolism, they could understand but couldn't
    get out of it; culture of resisting it is impossible; would bring
    harm to their families
*** TODO Purdom will post the titles and try to decide if it's worth doing more
    Kamikaze, Cherry Blossom, and Nationalism; and diary translations
*** sitting quietly, looking at kids in Yellowstone
*** Lydia tracked music (active engagement)
    the active engagement was a bust: there must have been music
    playing in the grocery store, but didn't remember; looking for how
    long she was sleeping and her heart-rate: active minutes per day
    (automatically collected); doesn't *do* anything with it; pay $50
    for fancy graphs; number of hours slept, average heart-rate, how
    many miles walked; number of active minutes: heart rate above
    normal for 10 minutes or longer; days that did yoga; no
    relationship between anything that she could find; maybe do it
    longer? look at a larger set of data? keeping a journal?
    interested in relationships between physical, sleep, heart-rate;
    average is 60; making a graph: using online things- some are in
    hours, some are in others; searched Google, used whatever came up
    first, but got frustrated; asked for support from friends over
    Skype; want to do another one-week tracking thing; outcome based;
    wasn't changing anything, behaving as normal; baseline
*** Gillette did exposure to the sun? vitamin D?
*** Old Faithful!
*** Bremen amount of times changing activities, changing focus
    sort of a nightmare in terms of tracking;
    tick-tick-tick-tick-tick; every time reading something for
    linguistics, thinking about something to alternatively do; a
    micro-tracking exercise, spaces within a specific conversation;
    paces that happen within a 10 minute interaction; want to track
    *smaller* time; tracking film editing; ways of deciding how you
    cut a particular piece of footage; if you watch an hour of
    footage, and cut it different ways; what is the productive
    potential of that kind of process, for material you know very
    well; productive potential inherent in both; some kind of measure
    of a normal ten minutes; compare them- police interrogation; how
    those expand out; slow mode in writing: can take forever, this can
    be done in writing; to slow down time you write more stuff;
    segment of ten minutes; footing: when you're speaking to someone-
    it's not about the words, but the codes in the posture; within a
    ten minute interaction, who gets the word; posture, tone, style
    cues; footing- it's about stage position; Irving Goffman talks
    about footing; Genette, grandfather of narrative theory; LeBeouf:
    interviewing young black children in Harlem- scariest moment in
    your life: linguistic reason that these stories are compelling-
    linguistic strategies; Frank Kermode; looking for when analyzing
    music- words don't have value in the analysis typically (maybe a
    joke?); there are micro-schools of thought;
*** can we do a ten minute interaction
    a lot was going on; capture: makerspace project- Becca posted to
    FB, arduinos on people's feet; how are we in-sync or out-of-sync;
    amazingly beautiful project where a director animated the staging
    cues for choreography; recording things; painting the horse as
    they see it;
*** Ethan's tracking
    cameras finally seeing things that humans can; prosthetics- two
    eyes, five senses; more granularity of things, we can see things
    that we couldn't previously see; trying to think about how our
    sensory perceptions of time day-to-day, not how physicist think we
    move through time; flat space-time, you're a line segment: in a
    four dimensional space; flow through time- have no idea why we see
    time that way; defamiliarize the sense of time, of one thing that
    happens one after it, things happen in a different order, both can
    be right; trying to think of time happening for things that aren't
    humans; obsessed with stuff; think about as much stuff as he
    could: how do the gym shorts experience time? listed every single
    thing that he interacted with every single day; sidewalks and
    streets; whatever seemed intuitive; wrote to thousand things down-
    on your shoulders all day; such a relief to stop; more hours would
    go by; had to remember everything that he touched; less human way
    of thinking about time; a couple of animations that touch on this,
    someone going through their day: explode it out to a graph of
    where it comes from; less human? linked to English scholarship,
    eco-crit; beyond human scale- construct representation;
    hyperobjects; post-humanism; deconstruction too, critiques of
    metaphysics; all of philosophy is anthropomorphic and
    ethnocentric; dark mountain project- collective that is trying to
    represent big time: clock that every hundred years it moves for a
    second; general thrust; not perfect; unnatural defenses article;
    thinking about the ways that objects are connected to climate
    change: intentionality- global warming; coconut
    oil->torture->global warming; last of inktober, when stuff breaks-
    a second life of books when something breaks; lifespan for broken
    shoes: batteries have different life spans; post-human scope- very
    human; not how space time actually is, causality still exists;
    things influence each other; Appalachian Junkumentary: Jacob Young
    talks about junk-yards, no we are salvage yards, some take pride
    in not crushing the cars; recycling centers- different laws that
    regulate; salvage- new laws about recycling and toxic waste; new
    laws about what you can do on your land; going there to get parts-
    junkyards; how people position themselves- "you can buy a new car
    here" but they can't keep up with regulations; leaking oil in a
    corn field, lady can't get a carburetor; eminence- you are part of
    something which is global warming or global capital
*** time scale of observation
    only in the aggregate that weather is the climate; moths have
    changed colors, white to grey; trying to see something bigger:
    China Mi√©ville- three points at an explosion: ice bergs in the sky
    in London, coral reef along Berlin wall;
*** TODO post and assign the reading from CM, from Purdom
*** citizen scientist projects
    Cornell bird project; backyard bird count; all the people who are
    interested in how many birds in the backyard; central database
    about migratory patterns;
