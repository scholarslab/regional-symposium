    "## A Jupyter Notebook with the Javascript Kernel Describing Coding Cloud Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I tracked the appearance of the clouds according to [this methodology](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/blog/2015/11/01/cloudmemos/), which basically asks that I fill a page of notes for each observation. The instructions were deliberately vague, so when I sat down to code all the data, I started looking for patterns. I first coded it in a [table in org-mode in Emacs](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/memo/2015/11/11/cloud-data/), which can easily be exported to a number of formats, including tab-separated values. You'll note that I regularized spelling, except for \"grey\" which I consistently spelled the British way (much prettier, don't you think?); I did not regularize, or rationalize, punctuation and made editorial comments&mdash;that is comments while transcribing&mdash;in brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) with a [Javascript kernel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ijavascript) running on my local machine. I'm interested in Jupyter because it allows for literate programming, where I explain my reasoning while using code. At this point, I don't expect to use *much* Javascript, but I want to get used to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first load a csv parser from npm. The \"require\" function can apparently load any package available in the npm repository, so it's no problem to load this one."
