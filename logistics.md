## Times and Dates

The regional symposium will run for one full day, March 9th 2018, starting with a 9:00 AM breakfast in the Scholars' Lab. The events will conclude around 5:30pm on Friday. A smaller group of administrators will be invited to stay for Saturday events so as to make plans based on feedback from the Friday events.

## Location & Directions

If you are driving to the Charlottesville area, you will probably want [Maps & Directions](http://www.virginia.edu/Map/) to the University of Virginia. Our local airport is [CHO](http://www.gocho.com/), a short taxi ride to the north of town. Charlottesville is approximately 110 miles and two hours south of Washington, DC.

The [Scholars’ Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab) is located in Alderman Library, behind the café to the left, on the main floor (4 West).
